# NewsApp

This is a very simple News App that loads data from a Rest Api and populates the screen with it. It follows MVVM Architecture with Jetpack ViewModels and follows repository pattern. For network requests it uses Retrofit and for offline caching Room persistance library. For Dependency injection it uses Dagger Hilt. For Asynchronous operation it uses Kotlin Coroutines and Flow.
